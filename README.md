# Silmaril

Silmaril is my project name for exploring small desktop decorative lights, using addressable LEDs and small stm32 dev boards, written in Rust.

I've posted some [videos on twitter](https://twitter.com/tene/status/1272950989461417984) of my [first prototype](https://twitter.com/tene/status/1279675284573130754).
